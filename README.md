# Housing-Price-Prediction

This is a Kaggle House Price Prediction Competition . The objective of the project is to perform data visulalization techniques to understand the insight of the data. Machine learning often required to getting the understanding of the data and its insights. This project aims apply various Python tools to get a visual understanding of the data and clean it to make it ready to apply machine learning operation on it.

The Housing price predicition is a getting started competition in Kaggle.
This competition does not count for ranking but it is a beginner friendly competition.

The Dataset can be downloaded from the kaggle website.

My code is divided into two parts:Data Analysis and Predicting the house prices.
Data Analysis  include understanding the problem,Hypothesis generation and data exloration.
Predicting the house prices include Feature Engineering,Model Training and Model Evaluation and Testing.

My score(as of 15:30 ,2-08-2020) is 14935.04279 and leaderboard rank is 3307.
